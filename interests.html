		Years ago, an IEEE article dismissed what it called the “cult” of information theory—the tendency to take Shannon’s mathematical framework and apply it everywhere, from poetry to prayer. This has long been a favorite article of mine, in part because of how sharply it provoked debate. The piece condemned this “overreach” as intellectual imperialism, as if the equations of communication had no business mingling with the messier equations of human life.

		And yet, here we are. Living, breathing, thinking creatures stitched together by information. DNA is information. Photosynthesis is information exchange at a planetary scale: photons translated into sugar, sunlight into survival. Even love—if you strip it down to its nervous signals and hormonal patterns—can be seen as an intricate code, one pulse whispering meaning into another.

		The IEEE critique wasn’t wrong so much as it was small. It mistook discipline for destiny. It forgot that information theory, like language itself, is not a cage but a ladder. John Archibald Wheeler once suggested that perhaps every it in the universe arises from answering a yes-or-no question—it from bit. Whether or not you take that literally, the idea points to a world that is less static substance than unfolding dialogue, where asking and listening matter as much as measuring.

		Which is why I have come to take those accusations of “overreach” as a kind of challenge. If information theory is accused of aspiring to touch everything, maybe that’s because everything—our breath, our data, our rituals—is already bound by the threads of information. Even black holes, once thought to erase stories forever, may carry faint traces—soft hair—that preserve what has fallen in. Meaning, it seems, resists annihilation.

		So these have become my goals: to extend human intelligence through the sciences of information; to study photosynthesis, and in it, to learn what symbiosis with the natural world really means; and to foster communities that stave off the terrible disease Kurt Vonnegut warned us about—loneliness.

		In the end, information isn’t just about compression or transmission. It is about connection. It is about finding one another in the noise, and choosing, again and again, to listen.
